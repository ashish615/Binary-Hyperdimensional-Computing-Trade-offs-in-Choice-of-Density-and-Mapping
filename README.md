# Binary-Hyperdimensional-Computing-Trade-offs-in-Choice-of-Density-and-Mapping

We provide Matlab implementation of the study called "Classification and Recall with Binary Hyperdimensional Computing: Trade-offs in Choice of Density and Mapping Characteristics"

These programs are licensed as GNU GPLv3.

All experiments are implemented in MATLAB. The code is structured into folders according to the sections of the article where the corresponding results were presented. 

In each folder the main files are the ones starting with FIG_. These files produce figures illustrating the results of experiments in the same way as they are presented in the article.
Other MATLAB files in folders are used during the execution of the main scripts. 

% Please be patient most of the experiments take some time as we repeat them many times. You can adjust the number of simulations in the code.

Please let us know if you face any problem or discover any bugs!
For more info, you can read and cite our paper once it is available
Thanks!
